## K-Nearest Neighbors Implementation

[KNearestNeighbors](https://github.com/XiongCynthia/KNearestNeighbors/blob/main/KNearestNeighbors.py) is a class for calculating k-nearest neighbors in a dataset.

### Usage

```python
from KNearestNeighbors import KNearestNeighbors
knn = KNearestNeighbors(x_train)
result = knn.get_nearest_neighbors(x_test)
```

More example usages are included in [KNearestNeighbors_examples.ipynb](https://github.com/XiongCynthia/KNearestNeighbors/blob/main/KNearestNeighbors_examples.ipynb).
